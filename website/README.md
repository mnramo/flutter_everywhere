# Flutter for Web

Flutter for Web is provided by `flutter_web`. For Issues and Setup Info refer to the docs [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter_web).

You can only access shared code stored in `core` since it does not depend on the Flutter SDK.

- Release Mode: `flutter packages global run webdev build`

- Debug Mode: `flutter packages global run webdev serve`
