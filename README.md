## Flutter Everywhere

The goal of this repo is to have everything you need to start with flutter desktop + mobile simply by forking the project. This will no longer be necessary once `flutter create` supports desktop.

Fork this project to get started! :)

## Getting Started - Mobile

1. Run `flutter build ios` || `flutter build apk`

## Getting Started - Desktop

1. Update your $PATH `export ENABLE_FLUTTER_DESKTOP=true`

2. Run `flutter run -d macos` || `flutter run -d windows` || `flutter run -d linux`
