## Flutter Everywhere

The goal of this repo is to have everything you need to start with flutter desktop + mobile simply by forking the project. This will no longer be necessary once `flutter create` supports desktop.

For now it includes the prebuilt binaries and you must edit rhe project [here](/flutter-desktop-embedding/project).

For now the flutter desktop needs the prebuilt binaries and has to be nested inside `flutter-desktop-embedding`.

Fork this project and start editing the `flutter_everywhere/flutter-desktop-embedding/project/lib/main.dart` :)
