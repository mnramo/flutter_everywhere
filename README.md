## Flutter Everywhere

The goal of this repo is to have everything you need to start with flutter desktop + mobile simply by forking the project. This will no longer be necessary once `flutter create` supports desktop.

Fork this project to get started! :)

# About Desktop Embedding for Flutter

This project was originally created to develop Windows, macOS, and Linux
implementations of [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). That work has
since become part of the
[Flutter engine repository](https://github.com/flutter/engine), and this
project is now just an example of, and test environment for, building
applications using those libraries.

For information about the shells themselves, see the [Flutter page about
desktop support](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells).
